## Getting started

Welcome to week 1 of spatial analysis for public health. This week we will be learning about the process of moving from visualizing spatial data through to exploration and analysis. We will get our hands dirty with some R code and learn how to make beautiful maps.

This week's [lecture]() will focus on some of the concepts behind spatial epidemiology. I will then walk you through some R code to load and visualize spatial data in [this video](). You will then have a chance to apply that code to new data and questions in this week's [assignment]().

As ever, post any questions on the b-courses piazza and if you are still having issues, join us on 1 of the office hour sessions where we can walk you through any challenges you are having.

Good luck!
